“balance3”, “glcube”, and “motion_client” are a bundle of programs I worked on that empahasize an interaction between physical data and a software environment.

“motion_client” is an application that allows device-motion data from one device to be sent to another device. 

“glcube” is a first test for “motion_client”. It renders a 3D cube to the screen that represents the user’s phone. Using “motion_client”, the user’s phone sends its accelerometer and gyroscope data to “glcube” rotating the 3D cube along three axes to correspond with the motion of the user’s phone.

“balance3” is a game I built using the Kivy platform. A lot like the old-school game labyrinth, the object of the game is to tilt your phone to navigate a ball to a goal.
