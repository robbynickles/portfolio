Though I have worked much with C, I have never built a large program using C. Instead I've given a set of small programs to demonstrate language proficiency. 

“erat.c” implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes, a simple algorithm to find prime numbers.

“hanoi.c” is a solver for the game Tower of Hanoi. You punch in the number of discs you’re using and it tells you what moves to make to solve the puzzle in the minimum number of steps.

“pfact.c” utilizes “erat.c” in order to generate prime factorizations for user-entered numbers.

“ptr1.c” and “ptr2.c” play with C’s notoriously confusing pointers.
