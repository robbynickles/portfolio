I have never built a large program using C. Instead I've given a set of small programs to demonstrate my proficiency in the language.

“erat.c” implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes, a simple algorithm to find prime numbers.

“hanoi.c” is a solver for the game Tower of Hanoi. You punch in the number of discs you’re using and it tells you what moves to make to solve the puzzle in the minimum number of steps. For example, the solution to the 9-disc puzzle has 511 moves.

“pfact.c” utilizes “erat.c” in order to generate prime factorizations for user-entered numbers.

“ptr1.c” and “ptr2.c” play with C’s notoriously confusing pointers.
